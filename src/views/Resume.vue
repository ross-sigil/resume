      A pile of retail jobs:
        I work with a team towards a common, well communicated and understood goal well. I've done factory work, and found myself to much prefer programming.

      College Works:
        President of AIX (AI Ext) helped explore solutions with using drones to analyze soybean fields using color as a metric for hydration. Other roles for this were communication and orgnizational ability.
        
        Developed a blockchain as a research project as a contact tracer for COVID-19. 
          The idea was that the service would run in the background and if another user came within a proximity determined by gps a token would be generated and transfered from each user.
          These tokens represent risk and the more a user has the greater their risk, they then use an exponential decay funtion as the user is progressively healed.
          We could generate a contact tree and organize that tree by risk.
